The purpose of this weather app is to prove myself using API tools and development of GUIs for the first time.

The user will be able to introduce the city and know the weather conditions in real time. The API will provide the data (temperature, what it feels like, wind speed, wheather description, pressure, etc.) to the app, which will manipulate and display it in a user-friendly manner on the screen.

Please note that if the given city is not provided by the API, the app will return a message to the user to let them know that the mentioned city is not available yet. As well, note that the API has
a limited number of calls per day. If it gives such an error, you can get your own API key (free) to make the app work by visiting https://openweathermap.org.
